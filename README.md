### What can be done

  * [Numerical G-G diagram][gg]: given a vehicle, and a speed, to compute its ax-ay diagram. The G-G diagram is a useful technique in vehicle design and parameters exploration. 

    This is solved as an optimization problem: for a given lateral acceleration, find the minimum/maximum feasible longitudinal acceleration.
    
  * [Optimal laptime simulation][optimal-laptime]: given a vehicle, and a circuit, to compute the optimal controls that minimize the laptime.

    This problem is solved using a first order collocation method, the trapezoidal rule, with higher-order methods planned to be implemented soon. The NLP is solved using [Ipopt][ipopt], and [CppAD][cppad] to enhance its performance (a lap-time around Circuit de Catalunya can be obtained with 500 points in approximately 1 minute).
    
    This is not a quasi-steady-state simulation. The model solves the fully transient states as in the dynamic equations without steady-state assumptions.

### The approach

The core of the software is a C++ library, that can be used through a Python API. Full documentation is not yet available but some examples can be found in [examples/python][examples-python]

### Dynamic models

The only model implemented to date, is a [Go-Kart model][link2] with 6DOF (x,y,z + yaw, pitch and roll). More models will be implemented.

The default parameters used can be found in [./database/roberto-lot-2016-kart.xml][database]

### Circuits

Circuits are modeled following [Peter De Buck¬¥s][dymos] approach: connecting straights and

### Dependencies

Fastest-lap uses several open-source libraries:
  * [Ipopt][ipopt]: Interior Point OPTimizer, is an open source software package for large-scale nonlinear optimization. Used within this project to obtain the solution to optimal laptime problems written as NLP (Non-linear programming problem).
  * [CppAD][cppad]: C++ Algorithmic Differentiation. Distributed alongside Ipopt, it is used to compute analytical derivatives. 
  * [Tinyxml2][tinyxml2]: TinyXML-2 is a simple, small, efficient, C++ XML parser, used to read XML files (e.g. model parameters, tracks,...)
  * [logger-cpp][loggercpp]: a simple logger in C++, to handle print levels, and other interesting add-ons
  * [lion-cpp][lioncpp]: lightweigh interfaces for optimization and numerics, a C++ package manager for all the libraries mentioned above, plus other numerical methods such as mechanical frames, vector algebra, and Runge--Kutta schemes

### Compilation

This project uses CMake to build the source code and produce the binaries.

The canonical steps to compile a CMake project are: (assume ```$FASTESTLAP``` is the source code top level.)

  1.  Create a build folder.
  ```
  mkdir ${FASTESTLAP}/build 
  ```
  2. From the build folder, run cmake
  ```
  cd ${FASTESTLAP}/build && cmake ..
  ```

  The options available for cmake are:
  ```
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug/Release
  -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/install/dir
  -DCHECK_BOUNDS=Yes/No
  -DCODE_COVERAGE=Yes/No: enables code coverage (if so, use with -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug)
  -DBUILD_DOC=Yes/No: builds doxygen documentation
  ```
  At this stage, CMake will download and install all the thirdparty dependencies.
  
  3. Compile 
  ```
  make
  ```
  
  4. Test (optional but recommended)
  ```
  ctest --verbose
  ```
  
  5. Install (optional)
  ```
  make install
  ```
