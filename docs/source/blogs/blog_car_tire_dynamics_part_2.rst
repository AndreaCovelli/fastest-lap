Car and tire dynamics at the limits of handling (Part II)
=========================================================
Right. Part II, here. we. go.

This blog is the continuation of Car and tire dynamics at the limits of handling (Part I), where we laid the foundation of tire grip generation and its relation to car acceleration in straight line. As surprising as it sounds, cars normally also need to take corners, which is the raison d’être for this second blog in the series.

Knowledge of how tires behave at the limits of handling is fundamental to grasp advanced concepts such as understeer and oversteer. Usually, these are presented as ‘when the car does not want to turn’ or ‘when the car turns more than what the driver commands to’. Do you want to level up from these definitions and master the underlying science? then my friend, you will enjoy the rest of this blog.

First and foremost, you need to understand that cornering also needs acceleration. Acceleration is the rate of change in the velocity, and when a car corners, it changes its velocity, precisely, its direction. In particular, cars need lateral acceleration to corner, and it is no surprise, that this acceleration is again produced by the grip of the tires.
